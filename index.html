            <h3>ðŸŽ€ About Me ðŸŽ€</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Hanya. I'm a rising senior studying Computer Science at Queens College
                I love combining my analytical mindset and creativity to build upon projects
                that challenge me to become a better programmer. <br><br>

                With experience in IT support, web development, social media marketing, and data analytics,
                I bring a versatile skill set that will allow me to adapt to different environments. <br><br>

                Outside of tech, I love to travel and explore places that I've never been. I also really enjoy 
                reading and photography, as well as making videos!
